    <h3>According to an IBOPE Zogby poll,</h3>
      <p>
         the average consumer lost an estimated $250 last year while waiting for in-home service. Multiply that $250 on a national scale, and you get $37.7 billion.

    <h3>The average wait time? </h3>
    <p>About four and a half hours, which happened on about three separate occasions for most Americans last year. All of that adds up to every American losing about two days of work a year. In fact, half of all respondents said they used a sick day or vacation time to be around for an in-home service.
